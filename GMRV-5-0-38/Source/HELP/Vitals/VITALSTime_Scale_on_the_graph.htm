<b>&quot;Actual Time&quot; on the Graph</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>By default, the graph displays data in evenly distributed 
 intervals, corresponding to the columns of the grid below. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The Time Scale feature displays data for the entire date 
 range on a single graph, distributed according to the date/time stamp 
 on the data. (For example, a data point for January 15 will be closer 
 to a data point for January 16, and a data point in February will be further 
 away.) The data in the grid is shown between two blue lines on the graph.
