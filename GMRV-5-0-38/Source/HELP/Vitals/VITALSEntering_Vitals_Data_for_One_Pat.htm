<b>Entering Vitals Data for One Patient</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>This procedure will help you enter a patient’s vitals 
 for more than one date or time in a single session. You can also see the 
 latest vitals on file for the patient as you enter the new values. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>If you need to enter the same vitals for more than one 
 patient, it may be easier to <a href="VITALSEntering_Data_for_Multiple_Patie.htm">enter 
 data for multiple patients</a>. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b><i>To enter vitals for one patient at a time:</i></b> 
 
<ol>
	<li>In the main Vitals window, <a href="VITALSSelecting_a_Patient.htm">select</a> 
	 a patient. The patient information opens in the Vitals window, showing 
	 existing vitals data on a graph and in a spreadsheet-like grid on 
	 the right side of the window. </li>
	<li>Click the <b>Enter Vitals</b> button above the graph. The Hospital 
	 Location Selector opens. <b>Note:</b> if the patient is associated 
	 with a hospital location, you will skip to step 4. </li>
	<li>Click one of the following three tabs to select a location: </li>
</ol>
The <b>Appointments</b> tab lists all appointments for this patient for 
 the last year. Click an appointment to select that clinic location. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The <b>Admissions</b> tab lists all existing admissions 
 for this patient. Click an admission to select that hospital location. 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The <b>Name</b> tab allows you to search for all available 
 hospital locations. Enter the first few letters of the location name to 
 open a list of locations, then click one to select it. 
<ol start="4">
	<li>The selected patient’s Name, SSN, and DOB are displayed in the 
	 navigation bar, along with the selected Hospital Location and current 
	 Date/Time. To use a different location, date/time, or template for 
	 this set of vitals: </li>
</ol>
Click the <b>Read Monitor</b> button to retrieve vital sign readings from 
 a vital sign monitor (VSM) connected to the workstation. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Date/Time</b> button to select a different 
 date or different time. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Hospital Location</b> button to select a 
 different location. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Exp. View</b> button to display or hide 
 the <a href="VITALSAbout_Templates.htm">Templates</a> panel. To select 
 a template, click any template name in the list. If no template has been 
 selected, the default System template will be used. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>You can also display or hide the latest vitals on file 
 for this patient by clicking the <b>Latest V.</b> button. The vitals data 
 will be shown at the bottom of the Enter Vitals window. 
<ol start="5">
	<li>Type a value for each vital sign or measurement, then press <b>Enter</b> 
	 to move to the next field. If you would like to select a different 
	 qualifier for a vital sign, click the down-arrow button to display 
	 a list of its qualifiers. </li>
</ol>
To enter a non-numeric value for a particular vital sign or measurement, 
 use one of these <a href="VITALSIf_vitals_data_is_unavailable.htm">options</a>. 
 
<ol start="6">
	<li>Click <b>Save</b>. To enter additional vitals for this patient, 
	 repeat steps 4–6 using a different date, time, and/or location. </li>
</ol>
To discard the vitals you have entered, click <b>Cancel</b>. You will be 
 prompted to confirm the cancellation. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>When you are finished entering vitals for this patient, 
 click <b>Save and Exit</b>. The Enter Vitals window closes.
