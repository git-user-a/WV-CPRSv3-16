<b>Entering Data for Multiple Patients</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>If you have taken vitals for a group of patients in one 
 ward or unit, this procedure will help you enter the vitals for all the 
 patients in one session. The location and date/time settings remain the 
 same throughout the session, so you can quickly enter the same vitals 
 information for each patient in the list. If your workstation is running 
 <a href="VITALSCCOW_Standard.htm">CCOW</a>, you will need to <a href="VITALSBreak_the_Clinical_Link.htm">break 
 the clinical link</a> before following this procedure. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>If you need to enter many different dates and times for 
 each patient, it may be easier to <a href="VITALSEntering_Vitals_Data_for_One_Pat.htm">enter 
 one patient at a time</a>. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>When more than one patient has been selected in the main 
 Vitals window, a Patient List box is displayed in the top left pane of 
 the Enter Vitals window. A bold black arrow indicates which patient is 
 active – as soon as you have finished entering vitals for the active patient, 
 you can click a different patient name to quickly switch between patients. 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b><i>To enter vitals for multiple patients:</i></b> 
 
<ol>
	<li>In the main Vitals window, <a href="VITALSSelecting_a_Patient.htm">select</a> 
	 two or more patients, then click the <b>Input Vitals for the Selected 
	 Patients</b> button below the patient list. The Hospital Location 
	 Selector opens. <b>Note:</b> if the patients are already associated 
	 with a hospital location, you will skip to step 3. </li>
	<li>Click one of the following three tabs to select a location: </li>
</ol>
The <b>Appointments</b> tab lists all appointments for this patient for 
 the last year. Click an appointment to select that clinic location. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The <b>Admissions</b> tab lists all existing admissions 
 for this patient. Click an admission to select that hospital location. 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The <b>Name</b> tab allows you to search for all available 
 hospital locations. Enter the first few letters of the location name to 
 open a list of locations, then click one to select it. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The Enter Vitals window opens, displaying all selected 
 patients in the Patient List box. A black arrow appears next to the active 
 patient’s name. 
<ol start="3">
	<li>The active patient’s Name, SSN, and DOB are displayed in the navigation 
	 bar, along with the selected Hospital Location and current Date/Time. 
	 To use a different location, date/time, or template for this set of 
	 vitals: </li>
</ol>
Click the <b>Read Monitor</b> button to retrieve vital sign readings from 
 a vital sign monitor (VSM) connected to the workstation. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Date/Time</b> button to select a different 
 date or different time. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Hospital Location</b> button to select a 
 different location. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Exp. View</b> button to display or hide 
 the <a href="VITALSAbout_Templates.htm">Templates</a> panel. To select 
 a template, click any template name in the list. If no template has been 
 selected, the default System template will be used. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>You can also display or hide the latest vitals on file 
 for the selected patient by clicking the <b>Latest V.</b> button. The 
 vitals data will be shown at the bottom of the Enter Vitals window. 
<ol start="4">
	<li>Type a value for each vital sign or measurement, then press <b>Enter</b> 
	 to move to the next field. If you would like to select a different 
	 qualifier for a vital sign, click the down-arrow button to display 
	 a list of its qualifiers. </li>
	<li>To enter a non-numeric value for a particular vital sign or measurement, 
	 use one of these <a href="VITALSIf_vitals_data_is_unavailable.htm">options</a>. 
	 </li>
	<li>Click <b>Save</b>. A check mark appears next to the patient’s name 
	 in the Patient List, indicating that you are finished with that patient. 
	 (If you do not want to save the vitals you entered for the active 
	 patient, click <b>Cancel</b>.) </li>
	<li>Click the next name in the Patient List. A black arrow appears 
	 next to the patient’s name, indicating that this is now the active 
	 patient. </li>
	<li>Repeat steps 3-6 until all patients have been processed. After 
	 all patient data has been saved, the Enter Vitals window closes. </li>
