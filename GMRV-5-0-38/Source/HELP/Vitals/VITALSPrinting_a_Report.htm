<b>Printing a Report</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Four standard reports are available in the Vitals application: 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b>Cumulative Vitals Report</b> Available for single 
 patient, entire ward, or selected rooms on a ward 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b>Latest Vitals by Location</b> Available for an entire 
 ward 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b>Latest Vitals Display for a Patient</b> Available 
 for single patient only 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b>Vitals Entered in Error for a Patient</b> Available 
 for single patient only 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>These reports cannot be viewed on-screen: they must be 
 printed. They require a device that can handle 80 or more columns. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b><i>To print a report:</i></b> 
<ol>
	<li>From the <b>Reports</b> menu in the main Vitals window, select 
	 a report. The Report Options window opens, showing the name of the 
	 selected report. </li>
	<li>In the <b>Include Patient(s)</b> section, select a specific patient, 
	 an entire ward, or specific rooms/beds on a ward. (The currently active 
	 patient is selected by default.) </li>
	<li>In the <b>Date Range</b> section, select a Start Date and an End 
	 Date for the selected report (if appropriate). Click the drop-down 
	 arrow next to the Start Date and End Date fields to view a calendar. 
	 <b>Note:</b> Start and End dates do not apply to the Latest Vitals 
	 by Location report or the Latest Vitals Display for a Patient report. 
	 </li>
	<li>In the <b>Device</b> section, enter a partial device name, then 
	 select the appropriate device from the list. </li>
	<li>In the <b>Queue To Run At</b> section, select a date and time to 
	 print this report (default is today). For obvious reasons, reports 
	 cannot be printed for a past date/time. </li>
	<li>Click <b>Print</b> to send the report to the selected device. </li>
</ol>
