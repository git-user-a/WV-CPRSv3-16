<b>What is CCOW?</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) standard 
 provides a way for VistA applications to synchronize their clinical context 
 based on the Clinical Context Object Workgroup standard. In simple terms, 
 this means that if CCOW- compliant applications are sharing context and 
 one of the applications changes to a different patient, the other applications 
 will change to that patient as well. By default, the CCOW link is automatically 
 active. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Vitals has been made CCOW- compliant and can now synchronize 
 with other CCOW- compliant VistA applications. For example, if you are 
 logged in on CPRS (which is also CCOW- compliant) and clicked the Vitals 
 link, the Vitals GUI will be launched and will open the same patient that 
 is active in CPRS. You can also open two different Vitals sessions and 
 not synchronize them, allowing you to view two patientsâ€™ charts at the 
 same time. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>For more information about using CCOW in Vitals, see
