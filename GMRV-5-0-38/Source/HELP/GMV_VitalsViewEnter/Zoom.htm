<b>Zoom</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>This feature is only available when the <b>Allow Zoom</b> 
 box is checked. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click the <b>Zoom Graph In</b> button (the magnifying 
 glass icon with the plus sign in the center) or the <b>Zoom Graph Out</b> 
 button (the magnifying glass icon with the minus sign in the center) to 
 expand or narrow down the scale of the graph. For example, if the value 
 in the <b>Zoom Percent</b> box is 10, the Zoom In / Zoom Out buttons will 
 enlarge or shrink the graph by ten percent each time you click the button. 
 Click the <b>Reset Zoom</b> button to reset the Zoom Percent box to its 
 original value. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>To zoom in on a particular section of the graph, you 
 can also click and drag inside the graph to select a range of data points. 
 The selected values expand to fill the graph area.
