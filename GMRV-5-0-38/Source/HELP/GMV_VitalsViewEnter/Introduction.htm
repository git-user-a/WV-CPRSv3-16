<b>Introduction to Vitals Lite</b> 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The Vitals application is designed to collect the vital 
 signs and measurements that are associated with a patient's hospital stay 
 or outpatient clinic visit, and store the data in the patient's electronic 
 medical record. Data can be accessed by several VistA (Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture) applications that interface 
 with the Vitals/Measurements application, such as CPRS, Health Summary, 
 and Pharmacy. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>The Vitals Lite module is available through CPRS and 
 is used to enter vitals data, view allergies, and mark incorrect vitals 
 as entered in error. 
<?rh-implicit_p ?><b><i>To open Vitals Lite from the CPRS v26 cover sheet:</i></b> 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>Click any item inside the <b>Vitals</b> section of the 
 <b>CPRS Cover Sheet</b> to open Vitals Lite. The Vitals Lite window provides 
 a limited set of Vitals features to CPRS users, and its functionality 
 is supplied by a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) from the Vitals application. 
 
<?rh-implicit_p ?>See Appendix C in the Vitals User Manual for more information 
 about Vitals Lite and its features. You can view or download the User 
 Manual from the VistA Documentation Library (VDL) at http://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appID=107
