Version T17 (GMV_VITALSVIEWENTER.DLL:v. 01/20/06 09:08)

ClearQuest tickets fixed in T17 include:

HDS00010773 - When you view the graph in 3D, the dots separate from
        the lines making it confusing and difficult to read.

        NOTE: 3D is not available if the "Time scale" is not checked.

HDS00010365 - CCOW and Vitals user if you select rejoin from vitals user
        and user this application's data CPRS greys out.

HDS00010542 - Vitals out-of-range error message does not specify which
        vital sign is out of range. The error message appears
        upon saving the vitals, not upon entering the out-of-range value.

HDS00010619 - Essentially if I select a pt without any existing vitals data,
        and Time Scale is NOT checked prior to entering data
        once the value is entered it wont display on graph until I place
        a check mark in Time Scale. Once I toggle back to NO time scale
        the display has been corrected.

HDS00010790,
HDS00010791 - GMRV*5*3 t16 error identified during internal testing.

        an incompatibility in the vitals dll version includes a spelling
